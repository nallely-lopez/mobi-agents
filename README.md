## 🎯 Problem Solved

Urban traffic congestion costs billions annually. MobiAgents uses autonomous AI agents to optimize ride-sharing and reduce traffic through intelligent route planning and dynamic matching.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **Intelligent Agents**: 4 autonomous drivers with decision-making AI
- 🧠 **Smart Matching**: ML-based passenger-driver pairing
- 📊 **Real-time Analytics**: Live performance metrics and charts
- 🗺️ **Interactive Map**: Visual city simulation with animated routes
- ⚡ **Dynamic Traffic**: Adaptive routing based on congestion levels
- 💰 **Economic System**: Fair pricing with supply-demand dynamics
- ⭐ **Reputation System**: Driver ratings affect matching priority

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5 Canvas, Vanilla JavaScript
- **AI Logic**: Custom decision tree algorithms
- **Blockchain**: Monad Testnet (integration ready)
- **Architecture**: Event-driven agent-based system

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Locally
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/nallely-lopez/mobi-agents.git
cd mobi-agents

# Open visualization
cd frontend
open index.html  # or double-click the file
```

### Run Backend Simulation
```bash
cd agents
npm install
node simulation-v2.js
```

**Key Metrics**
- ✅ 100% ride success rate
- 📊 Real-time earnings tracking
- ⚡ Energy management system
- 🎯 Smart route optimization

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Passenger Request**: Passenger agents request rides with destinations
2. **Smart Matching**: System evaluates all drivers based on:
   - Distance to passenger
   - Driver energy level
   - Current traffic conditions
   - Driver rating
3. **Dynamic Routing**: Selected driver calculates optimal route
4. **Trip Completion**: Earnings distributed, ratings updated

## 🎮 Agent Intelligence

Each driver agent makes decisions based on:
- **Energy Level**: Won't accept rides when tired
- **Fare Estimation**: Considers distance + traffic + demand
- **Rating Goals**: Maintains service quality
- **Traffic Awareness**: Avoids congested areas

## 📈 Results

- Average 5+ trips per driver per session
- $100-300 earnings per driver
- 90%+ customer satisfaction (ratings)
- Real-time congestion reduction

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Monad blockchain integration for payments
- [ ] Token rewards for efficient drivers
- [ ] Multi-city expansion
- [ ] NFT driver licenses
- [ ] DAO governance for pricing
